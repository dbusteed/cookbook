Don't worry about getting it all to dissolve.<SEP>Mix in the flour and salt - kneading is unnecessary. Add all of the flour at once, measuring it in with dry-ingredient measuring cups, by gently scooping up the flour, then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula. Don't press down into the flour as you scoop or you'll throw off the measurement. Mix with a wooden spoon, a high-capacity food processor (14 cups or larger) fitted with the dough attachment, or a heavy duty stand mixer fitted with the dough hook until the mixture is uniform. If you're hand mixing and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, you can reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together. Don't knead, it isn't necessary. You're finished when everything is uniformly moist, without dry patches. It takes a few minutes, and will yield a dough that is wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container.<SEP>Allow to rise. Cover with lid (not airtight or it could explode the lid off). Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse (or at least flattens on the top), approx 2 hours, depending on room temperature, and initial water temperature Longer rising times, up to 5 hours, won't harm the result.<SEP>You can use a portion of the dough any time after this period. Fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature.<SEP>#On Baking Day:<SEP>prepare your loaf tin, tray, or whatever you're baking it in/on. Sprinkle the surface of your refrigerated dough with four. Pull up and cut of a grapefruit-size piece of dough (c 1 lb), using a serrated knife.<SEP>Hold the mass of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it won't stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all 4 sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go. Most of the dusting flour will fall off - that's fine, it isn't meant to be incorporated. The bottom of the loaf may appear to be a collection of bunched ends, but it will sort itself out during resting and baking.<SEP>The correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive. The entire process should take no more than 30 - 60 seconds.<SEP>Rest the loaf and let it rise in the form, on the tray/pizza peel, for about 40 minutes Depending on the age of the dough, you may not see much rise during this period. That's fine, more rising will occur during baking.<SEP>Twenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450°F Place an empty broiler tray for holding water on any other shelf that won't interfere with the rising bread.<SEP>Dust and Slash. Dust the top of the loaf liberally with flour, which will allow the slashing knife to pass without sticking. Slash a quarter inch deep cross, diagonal lines, or tic-tac-toe pattern on top using a serrated knife.<SEP>After a 20 min preheat you're ready to bake, even though the oven thermometer won't be at full temperature yet. Put your loaf in the oven. Pour about 1 cup of hot water (from the tap) into the broiler tray and close the oven to trap the steam.<SEP>Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and firm to the touch.<SEP>Store the rest of the dough in the fridge in your lidded (not airtight) container and use it over the next 14 days. The flavour and texture improves, becoming like sourdough. Even 24 hours of storage improves the flavour.",

Uncover the bowl and add the salt, oil, honey, and lemon juice. Beat for 1 minute.<SEP>4. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups of flour, one cup at a time, mixing well between each cup. Knead the dough in the mixer (still using the dough hook) until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and feels smooth rather than sticky. This usually takes 10 to 15 minutes, but if your dough pulls away and loses its stickiness sooner, it could take as little as 5 minutes.<SEP>5. Grease two nonstick bread pans measuring 8 1/2\" x 4 1/2\" x 2 1/2\" to 9\" x 5\" x 3\" each (or grease two regular bread pans and then line them with parchment paper).

Form and place the dough into the prepared bread pans, gently pressing it into the corners.<SEP>7.

Alternatively, bake them in a 400-degree F (204°C) oven placed directly on the rack for roughly 20-35 minutes, depending on their size, until soft to the touch.<SEP>Cut cooked potatoes into bite-sized pieces (I usually quarter mine), and place vegan butter 1 Tbsp at a time onto the hot skillet. Only add enough to accommodate all of your potatoes.<SEP>TIP: Place potatoes, one by one, onto the skillet directly in the melted butter ensuring both exposed cut sides touch the butter and get some cook time in the skillet. This will ensure all sides get crispy brown.<SEP>Once all potatoes are on the skillet, spray the top with avocado or olive oil (optional) and season with half of the seasonings. Spraying them with oil helps the seasonings stick to the skin.<SEP>After about 4 minutes, use a fork or spatula to tip the potato over onto its other side to brown evenly.<SEP>After another 3-4 minutes, flip the potatoes on their backsides (skin side down) and season with remaining salt, pepper and garlic powder. Cook for another 2-4 minutes until crispy and golden brown on all sides.<SEP>Serve with hot sauce or Whiskey BBQ ketchup. These potatoes go great with omelets and Southwest Tofu Scramble."

    "directions": "Place the first five ingredients in the bowl and mix.<SEP>Add: 2 Cups 100% Whole Grain Wheat Flour. (to cool the water and end up with warm dough) Mix then add 2 Tbs of Dry Active Yeast. If your not sure about your yeast proof it in a little warm water first.<SEP>Add: 4 Cups of 100% Whole Grain Wheat Flour.<SEP>Mix until the consistency is some what even. Then continue to slowly add flour 1/2 Cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl. It should be tacky to the touch. The trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy. It will most likely be 6 1/2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1/2 cups of wheat flour. You can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish. Don't over mix or the bread will be tough.<SEP>When your dough is finished, leave it in the mixer, cover the bowl and let it rise for about 30-45 minutes. The dough will be larger but it doesn't need to double.<SEP>Grease two bread pans with Crisco. You can also flour the pans to reduce sticking.<SEP>Mix the dough again just enough to knock it down at least close to the original size.<SEP>Drop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it. Shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isn't sticky. Divide the ball in half and do it again. Shape the loaves by turning the dough under it's self over and over. When the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top. Drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 36 minutes. If you forgot to preheat 41 minutes. (gas oven).<SEP>When done turn the bread out of the pan to a rack to cool. You can eat it right away (a great time for real butter) don't wrap it until completely cooled. (Condensation will make it soggy) Put in tinfoil to store on the counter. If you put it in the refrigerator it will turn into a brick. Enjoy.",

    "directions": "To 3 small cups, add 1/4 cup of coolish water to each.  In 1 of the cups add the lipase and stir to combine (it won't dissolve completely).  To another cup add citric acid and stir to combine.  To the final cup, add the animal rennet and stir to combine.<SEP>Pour milk into the pot of the Instant Pot and clip a thermometer on to the side (or have one close by so you can closely watch the milk temperatures).  Press yogurt and adjust until it says “boil”.<SEP>Warm milk to 55°F.<SEP>When milk reaches 55° F, use a whisk and stir while pouring in lipase mixture.  Continue to whisk briskly while pouring in citric acid mixture<SEP>Continue to heat milk until it reaches 88°F; press cancel to turn off the Instant Pot.<SEP>Gently stir in rennet mixture using a slow up and down motion with the whisk, about 30 seconds.  Place a lid on the pot for 5-10 minutes, until there is a clear separation of the whey, otherwise known as a “clean break”.  The whey should be clear and yellow.  If it is still whitish or milky looking, put the lid on and wait another 5 minutes.<SEP>Using a long knife, spatula, or off set icing spatula (basically something long enough to reach to the end of the pot) Cut the curds by making 4 or 5 vertical cuts from the top to the bottom of the pot.  Then repeat this process on the other side to make a checkered pattern on the top.<SEP>Press yogurt, adjust to “boil”, and lightly stir the curds until the temperature reaches 105°F.  The temperature will vary slightly depending on where your thermometer is in the  curds and whey, so just move your thermometer around and take the pot off the heat once it reaches an average of 105°F.  Cover the pot and let sit 1 minute.<SEP>Using a slotted spoon, scoop large curds into a strainer (the Euro Cuisine yogurt strainers work great for this) and press lightly to remove some whey.  Tear 3 pieces of plastic wrap (large enough to wrap 3 balls of your final mozzarella) and set them to the side (don't stack them on to of each other!)<SEP>Transfer curds to a microwave safe pyrex bowl and microwave curds for 1 minute.<SEP>Tip: This next step will need some food safe gloves because the cheese is about to get quite hot!<SEP> Gently fold the the cheese over and over then drain the released whey.  Microwave for another 35 seconds, gently fold cheese over and over, drain released whey.  One last time – microwave for another 35 seconds, drain excess whey, sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and continue to fold and knead until cheese becomes smooth, shiny, and stretches like taffy (this is my favorite part!).<SEP>Working quickly so the cheese doesn't cool and become unstretchable, break cheese into 3 pieces and create a tight, smooth ball shape with each.<SEP>You can eat it hot at this point (so good!) or shape it and chill it for later.  It will store in the fridge for 1-2 weeks.<SEP>Tip:  While the cheese is hot, it will not maintain the shape very well.  I like to wrap it tightly in a piece of plastic wrap and twist the plastic wrap to create a tight ball.  Once the mozzarella cools, it will maintain this round shape.  You can also try dipping the hot mozzarella in  ice water for a 10 seconds, but I feel like the plastic wrap works better.",

    "name": "Mozzarella Cheese (Instant Pot)",
    "notes": "The mozzarella is the best when eaten warm right after it's made.  Chilling the mozzarella will change its texture a bit, but it is still delicious!  Cube it up for skewers, slice it up for topping pizza or grilled cheese sandwiches, or partially freeze it, then shred it.  If you have extra, I have frozen the cheese successfully.  In fact, I insist that it melts and oozes better after it has been frozen and thawed!<SEP>As I mentioned above, lipase is optional. I feel like it makes a softer more flavorful cheese, but you can definitely make it without."

    "directions": "In a stand mixer bowl, combine 1 ¾ cup bread flour, ¼ cup cake flour, 3 Tbsp granulated sugar, 1 tsp kosher salt, and 1 ¼ tsp instant dry yeast. Whisk all together.<SEP>Set your mixer with a dough hook attachment.<SEP>Add 1 large beaten egg and 3 ½ Tbsp milk and 3 ½ Tbsp water, both which have been kept at 86°F, to the bowl with dry ingredients.<SEP>Start kneading on low speed (speed 2). Use a silicon spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl a couple of times.<SEP>Continue to knead until it clings to the hook and cleans the sides of the bowl.<SEP>Once dough starts to come together, add the butter and continue to mix on low speed until butter has been incorporated. Then increase speed to medium and knead until dough is silky, smooth and elastic.<SEP>When the dough gets silky and smooth, pull the end of your dough with your thumb and fingers. Keep spreading the dough with your fingers, stretching the dough into thin translucent membrane. This test is called Windowpane Test to see if the dough's gluten has been developed enough. If the dough tears, the gluten isn’t quite ready yet. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and test again.<SEP>Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl (the seam on the bottom).<SEP>Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. I use a Proof setting (100°F / 38C) in my oven.<SEP>Now for the biscuit dough...<SEP>In a clean stand mixer bowl, add about 4 Tbsp unsalted butter and ½ cup granulated sugar.<SEP>Mix until well blended and smooth.<SEP>Slowly add very small amount of 1 large beaten egg into the bowl and blend well together before you add another small amount of the egg. Continue until all the egg is well blended.<SEP>Sift 1 ½ cup + 2 Tbsp cake flour and ½ tsp baking powder to the mixture.<SEP>Mix until it’s incorporated and the dough is not floury. Then take out the dough and form into a ball.<SEP>Roughly cut the dough into 10 pieces.<SEP>Roll the 10 pieces of biscuit dough into 10 balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with silicone baking mat or baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes until it hardens a bit.<SEP>Now back to the main dough!<SEP>Once the dough has doubled in size, dust your index finger with flour and put it in the center of the dough. If the hole doesn’t close, then the dough is ready for next step.<SEP>Remove the dough with silicone dough scraper and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough with your hands to release gas in the dough and deflate.<SEP>Fold the dough in thirds and then fold in thirds again. Flip to keep the seam side on the bottom. Shape the dough into a ball. To close the seam line, rotate the dough (clockwise) with both hands while the seam line is touching the work surface.<SEP>Using a dough scraper, roughly cut the dough into 10 equal pieces.<SEP>Shape each dough piece into a nice round ball, pulling from all the sides and tuck into the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand, keeping the seam side on the bottom.<SEP>Put the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Cover the dough with plastic wrap (I use a cupcake holder lid) to prevent from drying. Rest the dough for 15 minutes at room temperature.<SEP>Put the Biscuit Dough on the lightly floured work surface and flatten the dough with your hand.<SEP>Using a rolling pin, roll out into 4 inch (10-12 cm) flat rounds. Continue the rest until the main dough is ready.<SEP>After 15 minute of resting, flatten the main dough with your hand and fold in thirds.<SEP>Then fold in thirds one more time and pinch both ends to shape the dough into a ball.<SEP>Pull the dough from all sides towards the seam on the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand a few times, keeping the seam side on the bottom.<SEP>Place the Biscuit Dough on your palm and put the Main Dough in the middle, seam side facing up.<SEP>Then flip to show the Biscuit Dough on top. Gently pull all sides of the Biscuit Dough wrapping around the Main Dough.<SEP>Coat the Biscuit Dough with granulated sugar (2 Tbsp) and remove the excess sugar. Then using a dough scraper or knife, gently score the Biscuit Dough into crisscross pattern (I score 3 lines each side).<SEP>Place the dough on the baking sheet, seam side on the bottom. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent from drying.<SEP>Let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough rises one and a half (1.5 x) in size, about 50 minutes (I used the Proof setting (100F / 38C) in my oven).<SEP>When the dough has risen half way, preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Note: If you are using the oven for proof, you have to transfer the dough to a warmer place so you can preheat the oven.<SEP>Bake at for 13-15 minutes. Toward the end of baking if you see the bread is not being browning evenly, rotate the bread once so that the bread gets even color.<SEP>Once bread is baked, transfer to a wire rack and let it cool. Keep in an airtight container or bag after it’s been cooled. Enjoy!",

    "directions": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line one large, rimmed baking sheet and one smaller sheet with parchment paper. Place the spinach, cilantro, jalapeño, shallot, garlic, salt and 1/2 cup of the vegetable broth in a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth.<SEP>Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the rice and stir to coat. Spread the rice in an even layer on the bottom of the pot and let the rice lightly brown. This happens quickly! When the rice starts to brown, stir it and spread it out in an even layer again so that more of the rice browns.<SEP>When most of the rice has lightly browned, scrape the green purée into the rice. Stir until the rice is evenly coated with green purée and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for a minute. Add the rest of the vegetable broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer and cover the pot. Cook the rice on a very low simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes.<SEP>While the rice cooks, toss the sweet potatoes in the olive oil, smoked paprika and salt until the sweet potatoes are evenly coated in oil. Arrange in a single layer on your prepared baking sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until the sweet potatoes are tender and caramelizing at the edges.<SEP>Meanwhile, transfer the beans and their cooking liquid (don’t drain the beans) to a medium pot. Stir in the cumin and chili powder and warm over medium heat. Once the beans are simmering, cover the beans and reduce heat to maintain a very gentle simmer until you’re ready to serve.<SEP>Once the rice is done cooking, remove the pot from heat. Uncover the pot and place a clean tea towel over the pot, then recover. The towel will help absorb excess liquid as the rice continues to cook in its own steam. (If you don’t have a clean towel, you can skip this step, just cover normally.) Let sit for 10 minutes.<SEP>Once the sweet potatoes are done cooking, toss the pepitas with 1/4 teaspoon olive oil and a sprinkle of salt on the small baking sheet. Toast the seeds in the oven for 4 to 5 minutes, until they’re turning lightly golden and making little popping noises. Set aside to cool.<SEP>Fluff the rice with a fork and season with salt if necessary. Remove beans from heat, stir in the vinegar and season to taste with salt and pepper.<SEP>Assemble your bowls: First add green rice, then use a slotted spoon or fork to transfer beans to the bowls. Top with sweet potatoes and add a few slices of avocado to each bowl. Sprinkle with toasted pepitas and cilantro and optional feta. Serve with salsa verde on the side.",

In a small bowl, whisk together milk and yogurt; place in refrigerator until ready to use.<SEP>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside.<SEP>Place a large plate or small rimmed baking sheet on top of a kitchen scale and zero the scale. Remove the butter from the freezer and unwrap it. Using a flat, open hand, position the butter lengthwise against the large holes of a box grater. Grate as much butter as you can without grating your fingers or hand until you have a total of 5 ounces/140 grams grated frozen butter.<SEP>Immediately transfer the grated butter to the large bowl with the flour mixture and toss gently with your fingertips until the butter is thoroughly coated in the flour mixture and no clumps of butter remain.<SEP>Add the refrigerated milk-yogurt mixture to the large bowl and fold the mixture until it forms a very rough, shaggy ball. Dump the mixture out onto a generously floured countertop and, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, knead four to five times until dough just holds together. Flatten into a rough 4-inch square with your hands.<SEP>Using a rolling pin, roll the mixture out into a rough 12-inch square, flouring generously as needed to prevent the dough from sticking to the counter or the rolling pin. Using a bench scraper, fold the sides of the square across the center in thirds like a business letter. Flatten gently with your hand, then fold the top and bottom thirds into the center to form a rough 4-inch square. Flatten the square out with your hands.<SEP>Roll the square out into a 12-inch square again. Starting at the bottom edge, roll the dough up like a jelly roll into a tight log. Lay the log seam-side down, then press into a rough 3-by-12-inch rectangle. Cut the rectangle crosswise into four 3-by-3-inch squares, then cut each square across the diagonal to form 2 triangles (for a total of 8 triangles). Transfer the triangles to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them out evenly.<SEP>Melt 3 tablespoons of the remaining butter and brush it over the tops of the biscuits. Bake until golden brown and puffed, 16 to 20 minutes. Remove biscuits from oven and brush the tops with a little more melted butter. Allow to cool slightly, then serve.",

Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.<SEP>Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.<SEP>Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.<SEP>At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.",

    "directions": "Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan with parchment paper or waxed paper and grease the sides of the pan. (Be sure to grease the sides really well!) Wrap the outside of the pan with 2 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil and set it in a large roasting pan, or any pan that’s larger than the springform. Bring a kettle or pot of water to boil.<SEP>In a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, beat the eggs at high speed until the volume doubles. This usually takes about 5 minutes.<SEP>Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter together. You can either do this in a double boiler on the stove (by placing the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl, set over a pan of almost-simmering water, and stirring until melted and smooth). Or you can do this in the microwave (by heating the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate and butter are melted and smooth). Then fold about a third of the beaten eggs into the chocolate mixture using a large rubber spatula until only a few streaks of egg are visible. Fold in half of the remaining egg foam, and then the last half of the foam, until the mixture is totally homogenous.<SEP>Scrape the batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with a rubber spatula. Place the roasting pan on the oven rack and VERY carefully pour in enough boiling water to come about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the cake has risen slightly, the edges are just beginning to set, a thin-glazed crust (like a brownie) has formed on the surface, and an instant-read thermometer inserted halfway into the center reads 140° F, 22-25 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water bath and set on a wire rack; cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until cool. (The cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.)<SEP>About 30 minutes prior to serving, carefully remove the sides of the springform pan, invert the cake onto a sheet of waxed paper, peel off the parchment paper, and re-invert the cake onto a serving platter. If desired, lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar and top with berries. To slice, use a sharp, thin-bladed knife, dipping the knife into a pitcher of hot water and wiping the blade before each cut.<SEP>I like it cold, so I'll put it in the freezer/fridge before serving (Sylvia).",

Using your hands, pat the dough into a 1/4 inch thick disc, keeping it round and the edges even. Cover the disc with another layer of plastic wrap if desired. Roll from center to edges to form a 14-inch circle. Fold the rolled dough into quarters. Make cuts along the folds to allow steam to escape. Unfold it over the filling. Using kitchen shears, trim pastry 1 inch beyond the rim. Fold top edge under the trimmed bottom edge and flute edge (create a decorative edge) to seal.<SEP>For a lattice-top pie, place the second ball of dough in the center of a lightly floured surface of plastic wrap. Roll dough from center to edges to form a 12-inch circle. Using a pizza cutter or decorative pastry wheel, cut pastry in 112-inch strips. Starting at the center of the pie, weave dough strips over filling to make a lattice. Press ends of strips into the rim of the bottom crust. Fold bottom crust over strips and flute the edge to seal.<SEP>Brush crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar. <SEP>Fold a 12-inch square of aluminum foil into quarters. Cut out the center section, making a 7 1/2-inch circle. Unfold the foil and place the square section over the pie. You may also use a long strip of foil 5 inches wide to wrap around the pie. When placing the foil on the pie, place the shiny side out to reflect the heat away from the crust. Loosely mold the foil over the edges to protect them from burning.<SEP>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly."

The ice cream will melt quickly so I recommend freezing them immediately for a few hours or until ice cream balls are completely frozen solid.<SEP>Once the ice cream balls are frozen solid and ready, you can start making mochi. Combine shiratamako and sugar in a medium microwaveable bowl and whisk all together.<SEP>Add water and mix well until combined.<SEP>Cover the bowl with some plastic wrap (do not cover too tight). Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it on high heat (1000w) for 1 minute. Take it out and stir with a wet rubber spatula. Cover again and cook for 1 minute. Stir again, cover, and cook for 30 seconds to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.<SEP>Cover a work surface with parchment paper and dust it generously with potato starch. Then transfer the cooked mochi on top.<SEP>To prevent from sticking, sprinkle more potato starch on top of the mochi. Once it has cooled down a bit, you can spread the mochi into a thin layer with your hands or with a rolling pin. Make sure to apply potato starch on your hands and the rolling pin. <SEP>Transfer the parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15 minutes until the mochi is set.<SEP>Take out the mochi from the refrigerator and cut out circles with the cookie cutter.<SEP>Dust off the excess potato starch with a pastry brush. If you find some sticky part, cover the area with potato starch first then dust off. Place a plastic wrap on a plate and then mochi wrapper on top, then lay another layer of plastic wrapper down. Repeat for all wrappers. With leftover mochi dough, roll into a ball and then flatten into a thin layer again and cut out into more circle wrappers.<SEP>Now we’re ready to form mochi ice cream balls. On the work surface, place one sheet of plastic wrap with a mochi layer on top. Take out one ice cream ball from the freezer and put it on top of the mochi wrapper. Pinch the four corners of the mochi layer together to wrap the ice cream ball.<SEP>Quickly cover with plastic wrap and twist to close. Place each mochi ice cream into a cupcake pan to keep the shape. You will need to work on one mochi ice cream at a time in order to keep the ice cream frozen all times. Put mochi ice cream back into the freezer for a few hours. When you’re ready to serve, keep them outside for a few minutes until mochi softens.",
